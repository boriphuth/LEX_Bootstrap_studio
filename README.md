## Usage

This github repo is powered by the [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://lightningdesignsystem.com) and is run on the [Bootstrap Studio Program](https://bootstrapstudio.io/), a WYSIWYG editor for components.

Components can simply be dropped from the left hand editor of the page to allow for you to simulate the lightning experience for end users.  JQuery can be used to add additional functionality for end users.
